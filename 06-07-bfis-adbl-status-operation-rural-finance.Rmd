# Bank and financial institutions, their status, challenges and contribution to national economy

## Financial institutions

Financial sector refers to all the wholesale, retail, formal and informal institutions in an economy offering financial services to consumers, businesses and other financial institutions. In its broadest definition, it includes everything from banks, stock exchanges, and insurers, to credit unions, microfinance institutions and money lenders (DFID, 2004).

**What does the financial system do and how could it promote economic growth?**^[The Finance and Growth Nexus" available at \url{www.philadelphiafed.org/files/br/brjf00ak.pdf}]

To understand how the financial system might influence economic growth, we need to review the roles of the financial system in greater detail.

1. Financial system mobilizes savings. Since an individual saver may be unable or unwilling to completely fund a borrower, financial markets and institutions pool the savings of diverse households and make these funds available for lending. This activity reduces the transaction costs associated with external finance for both firms and households. By going directly to a financial institution, firms seeking to borrow avoid the costs of having to contact a diverse group of savers. Similarly, savers avoid the costs of evaluating every potential borrower by placing their funds with a financial institution. 
2. Financial system allocates savings by determining which borrowers obtain loans. Since financial institutions are specialists, they can determine worthwhile investment opportunities and judge the creditworthiness of borrowers at lower cost than the average small investor. 
3. Financial system is to reduce risk by spreading investors' savings across many different investment opportunities. Spreading savings diversifies risk for households and reduces their exposure to the uncertainty associated with individual projects. This reduction in risk encourages savings.
4. Financial system derives from its ability to generate liquidity. Some investments with potentially high returns involve projects that require long-term commitments of capital. However, some investors may unexpectedly need access to their savings. Fortunately, when the financial system pools the investments of many households, it allocates funds to both short- and long-term projects. Thus, investors obtain higher returns on their savings than they would if their investments were limited to short-term projects, but they still have access to their savings in unforeseen circumstances. Further, mixing investments in this way ensures that worthwhile long-term projects are funded. 
5. Financial system facilitates trade by extending credit and guaranteeing payments. For example, currency, demand deposits, and credit card accounts all allow individuals to exchange goods and services without having to resort to barter. Additionally, letters of credit help firms order the inputs for current production when they experience delays in payment for past sales.
6. Financial system also exerts corporate control and monitors managers. Entrepreneurs' or managers' information about the operation and outcome of their projects tends to be superior to information that outside creditors and shareholders have. Insiders' attempts to exploit this informational advantage by engaging in opportunistic behavior would tend to discourage savings. For example, managers might underreport their firms' profits to lenders and shareholders in order to raise their own earnings. To offset this information advantage, banks monitor borrowers, and equity markets allow shareholders to discipline managers by voting out poor management.

A modern financial system is important in the economy in order to

- pool and utilize financial resources,
- reduce costs and risks,
- expand and diversify opportunities,
- increase the allocative efficiency of resources and
- promote the productivity and facilitate the economic growth.

As a country's financial sector develops and becomes more efficient, it enables individuals and institutions to channel savings to more productive enterprises. This offers the prospect of significant growth in GDP. Hence, while a sound and healthy financial system contributes to the growth of the real sector on a sustainable basis, uncertainty and fragility in the financial system adversely affect the objectives of economic development in general and poverty reduction in particular, as witnessed by the experiences of the financial crises of the 1990s.

Moreover, from the point of view of central banks, developments in the financial sector have a special role that distinguishes them from other services. Financial developments influence the long term output and employment growth, they can affect the wide range of indicators and tools that central banks use to monitor and model the behavior of the economy.

The efficiency of a financial system typically depends on several key factors, including its degree of integration, market competition, level of development and innovation capacity. Indeed, there is a significant amount of empirical evidence derived from cross-country data showing that countries in which more credit to the private sector is extended typically experience stronger economic growth.

### Status and history^[https://www.nrb.org.np/contents/uploads/2020/11/Special_Publications-Nepalese_-Financial_-System_Growth_-and-_Challenges_July-2009.pdf]

In Nepal, the process of financial liberalization was actually initiated in the mid-1980s when the government gave a green signal for the entry of commercial banks in joint venture with foreign banks. With the need to modernize banking services through the transfer of technology and managerial skills, Nabil Bank Limited was established in 1984 as the first joint-venture bank in Nepal, which was subsequently followed by the establishments of Nepal Investment Bank Limited and Standard Chartered Bank Nepal Limited.

The process of financial liberalization gained momentum in 1987/88 when Nepal entered into a three-year Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) with the IMF. The broad aim of this programme was to increase the role of market forces in the financial system. The NRB initiated regular auctions of treasury bill since 1988/89 in order to introduce greater flexibility in the interest rate structure. It also redesigned its rediscounting rates in the form of three windows: basic rate, selective rate and lender of the last resort rate in 1989.

For reducing the dependence of commercial banks on the NRB for short-term borrowing requirements, a call money market was set up during 1988/89. During the same period, a comprehensive study entitled "Commercial Bank Problem Analysis and Strategy Study (CBPASS)" was undertaken in order to improve the financial and organizational structure of the two state-owned commercial banks (Nepal Bank Limited [NBL] and Rastriya Banijya Bank [RBB]). Some of the suggestions incorporated in the CBPASS were implemented in 1990/91^[These included the recapitalization of the banks, repayment of government guaranteed loans and issue of government securities for provision for loan loss.].

Because of the satisfactory results of the SAP, Nepal entered into another three-year Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) with the IMF in 1992/93. During that period, the core focus of financial liberalization was directed towards a) allowing market forces to play a greater role in the financial system, b) enhancing private sector participation in the development of the financial system, c) increasing competition and thereby efficiency of the financial system, d) improving and increasing increase financial instruments and e) developing the capital market.

Under the loan assistance of the World Bank and grant assistance of the Department for International Development (DFID) of the United Kingdom, the Financial Sector Technical Assistance (FSTA) Project has been implemented since 1998. The re-engineering of the NRB, restructuring of NBL and RBB and capacity building in the financial sector are the main components of the Project. Under FSTA, Project, some progress has been made in strengthening the regulatory and supervisory capabilities of the NRB. A new licensing policy in 2002 (last revised in 2007) was framed for opening a new commercial bank or financial institution^[This policy clearly spells out the following aspects: (a) minimum paid-up capital required, (b) share ownership structure, (c) depositing amount of share capital committed by the promoters, (d) special provisions on minimum paid-up capital for establishing bank/financial institution in economically backward regions of the country, (e) promoters' educational qualification, working experience and financial disciplinary aspects, (f) provisions on sale or transfer of the promoter shares, and (g) application processing time.].

An array of reform measures pertaining to financial sector legislation included the enactment of a new Nepal Rastra Bank Act, 2002 and Debt Recovery Act, 2002. With the enactment of the Nepal Rastra Bank Act, 2002, the central bank of the country has become an independent body in executing its policies for ensuring sound, efficient and healthy financial system through prudent regulatory and supervisory mechanism^[According to the NRB Act, 2002, the major objectives of NRB are as follows: a) formulation of monetary and foreign exchange policies in order to maintain the stability of price and BoP for sustainable economic development; b) promoting stability and liquidity required in banking and financial sector; c) developing secure, healthy and efficient payment system; d) regulating, inspecting, supervising and monitoring the banking and financial system; and e) promoting entire banking and financial system of Nepal and enhancing its public credibility. The Act also makes the NRB mandatory to make public the monetary policy report. For details, see NRB (2002).]. A Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) was set up under the Debt Recovery Act, 2002 with the aim of improving the legal and judicial processes of recovering problem loans of banks and financial institutions.

Although the Credit Information Bureau (CIB) was established in 1989 under the initiation of Nepal Rastra Bank, it was registered as a company in September 2004 and started its operation as a company from March 2005. The CIB is the prime organization in the country acting as the repository of credit information of the customers and commercial borrowers of all the banks and financial institutions. It collects the credit information from the banks and financial institutions and disseminates them on demand. Regulatory provisions on blacklisting the borrower and credit information were revised. 

To make the legal structure pertaining to banks and financial institutions up-dated, strong and convenient for the purpose of making bank and financial sector transactions healthy, secured and sound, the Secured Transactions Act and Insolvency Act were made effective from November 16, 2006 and November 20, 2006, respectively.

With a view to develop the NRB into a modern central bank, capable in maintaining financial sector stability, the second phase of financial sector reform is being focused on updating the information technology, supervisory capability and human resource management. Moreover, the accounting system of the NRB is being updated to comply with the requirements of international accounting standard and Nepal accounting standard.

In 2004, Bank and Financial Institution Ordinance was enacted and the new legal framework replaced different fragmented legal framework governing the operations of banks and financial institutions^[The Bank and Financial Institution Ordinance, 2004 has made a provision of categorizing deposit-taking financial institutions into four categories: A, B, C and D. With the enactment of a single or umbrella act governing the functions of deposit-taking financial institutions in Nepal, the issues related to the establishment, operation and exit of banks and financial institutions have been clearly spelt-out in the new legal framework. It should be noted that the Bank and Financial Institution Ordinance 2004 was converted into Bank and Financial Institution Act (BFIA) 2006 and made effective from November 3, 2006.]. In the context of promulgation of the Banks and Financial Institutions Act (BFIA), the existing prudential regulations and directions, which were separately issued for banks and financial institutions, have already been revised and integrated into a unified directive and came into implementation from July 16, 2005. 

To minimize the risk involved in the financial sector, the regulation regarding risk management has already been issued. To monitor such system by the NRB, the policy of implementing risk-based supervision is also being pursued. To develop risk management system, the private sector has been encouraged to establish a credit rating agency. 

In reference to the building up of appropriate infrastructure for the implementation of BASEL II Accord since 2007, necessary directives, policies and provisions for the banks and financial institutions have been formulated in compliance with the accord. Further, as per BASEL II Accord, the regulatory provision has been prepared complying with the Simplified Standardized Approach (SSA) for capital base and Basic Indicator Approach (BIA) for operational risk. 

The large amount of non-performing assets (NPA) has been a major challenge for financial sector development and its stability^[The overall size of NPLs in the Nepalese banking system has been estimated at about 8.98 percent as of mid-January 2008.]. As a measure to reduce the NPA level, the NRB is coordinating with the government in strengthening the capacity of Debt Recovery Tribunal and establishing an ‘Asset Management Company' (AMC).

To discourage the possible fraud and crimes in the financial system, the "Anti-Money Laundering Act 2008" and "Banking Crime and Punishment Act, 2008" have been enacted on January 28, 2008 and February 5, 2008 respectively. In this connection, the Financial Intelligence Unit has been established in the NRB and the related by laws and directives are being prepared. 

The profile of all commercial banks and financial institutions along with their major financial indicators has been prepared and posted on the web site of NRB to provide adequate information on financial conditions of commercial banks and financial institutions to the public. In addition, the directives issued to the licensed financial institutions by the NRB on the basis of on-site and off-site supervision has been placed on the website from 2006/07 for the use of the general public.

The NRB as a regulator and supervisor of the banking and financial sector has been trying to ensure a healthy, and efficient financial sector by improving regulation on par with international standard. As such, the capital adequacy, single borrower limit, loan loss provisioning, professionalism of the promoter, standardized capital base, total deregulation in interest rate, open licensing policy, phasing out the directed credit, etc., have been the major prudential regulatory reforms undertaken by the NRB. 

The NRB as a central bank has been contributing through the sequential financial sector liberalization, extending financial services to the people, who were previously beyond the reach of banking and financial services, and the process of deregulation to micro finance activities. Similarly, the micro-finance activities are encouraged through the establishment of microfinance development banks, micro-finance institutions and non-government organizations together with the contribution made by the NRB in the self-reliance fund (SRF).

Against this perspective, the Government unveiled the National Micro-Finance Policy on May 4, 2008 with the objective of enhancing the capacity for microfinance. As per the Policy, a separate body would be set up to regulate and supervise the microfinance. The aim of the Policy is to increase access of microfinance to backward and financially weak families and women for improving employment opportunities. National Microfinance Development Fund would be established to mobilize resources from local and international communities. The NRB would monitor and supervise the implementation of this Policy. 

The NRB has revised some of the regulatory norms that are not consistent with the market oriented economic policies. The provision relating to the interest rate spread has been abolished and the mandatory requirement of investing in priority sector for commercial banks has been phased-out. From 2007/08 onwards, priority sector lending requirement will not be mandatory for commercial banks. 

In the process of accession to the World Trade Organization, Nepal had made commitments in financial services under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) and the Annex on Financial services. But, all the commitments are conditional upon entry requirement, domestic laws, rules and regulations as well as the terms and conditions of the NRB and Insurance Board. Financial services can carried out in Nepal through a domestically incorporated company. Branches of foreign banks are to be given a green signal for wholesale banking as of January 1, 2010. However, only those financial institutions that obtain a rating of at least 'B' from prominent global credit rating agencies such as Moody's and Standard and Poor's will be permitted to seek commercial business in the country. Against this perspective, considering the beginning of banking transactions by foreign banks in Nepal and opening of branches by the Nepalese banks abroad, the bank has prepared a new draft of 'Banks and Financial Institutions Act' as per international standard and submitted to the Ministry of Finance. The draft contains special and separate provisions for the licensing and the operation of foreign bank branches.

Due to the various measures initiated by the NRB in the financial sector of the country and thus generating a hospitable environment for the entry of new financial institutions, many financial institutions have been established and competition has been boosted to some extent. Overall, as of mid-January 2021. Table \ref{tab:status-institutions-in-nepal} and \ref{tab:financial-sector-stability-2020} summarizes the categories and respective number of banks and financial institutions. Commercial banks, development banks, finance companies and cooperatives and NGOs licensed to undertake limited banking businesses fall under the regulatory and supervisory jurisdiction of the NRB. Given the relatively small and under-developed economic base of the country, Nepal has a reasonably diversified financial sector as evidenced by the number and variety of institutions that play an active role in the sector.

Development banks and finance companies are not permitted to take demand deposits or undertake foreign currency business, but are otherwise treated similarly to commercial banks. A number of development banks were established with active participation of private sector after the Development Bank Act 1996 became effective with the aim of enhancing agriculture, industry and commerce through the provision of credit. Prior to this Act, there were only two development banks namely Agricultural Development Bank (which has been converted into commercial bank) and Nepal Industrial Development Corporation, both owned by the government. At present, development banks are operating under Bank and Financial Institutions Act 2006 possessing the status of "B" class financial institutions. NRB issues necessary directives on regular basis for the effective regulation of these banks.

The establishment of finance companies speeded up after the first amendment of the Finance Companies Act 1986 in 1992. At present, these companies operate under Bank and Financial Institutions Act, 2006 as "C" class financial institutions. Cooperatives, on the other hand, have been set up under Cooperatives Act 1992. The NRB has licensed a small number of these cooperatives to undertake limited financial transactions. These cooperatives operate under the directives issued by the NRB. There are also NRB-licensed NGOs to undertake limited banking transactions in accordance with the provision of the Financial Intermediation Related Institutions Act 1999.

The Employees Provident Fund (EPF), established on September 16, 1962 under the Employees Provident Fund Act 1962, manages the provident fund of the government employees, army, police, teachers, government corporations, and of some private companies. On the other hand, the Citizen Investment Trust (CIT) mobilizes the private and institutional savings, extends loans and advances, and works as an issue manager. The Ministry of Finance regulates the CIT which was set up in March 18, 1991. The Postal Savings Bank, on the other hand, established under the Postal Service Department, Government of Nepal came into operation in 1976. This service has played a role in inculcating the habit of saving on the part of people in lower level income groups.

The financial sector also encompasses areas such as capital market and insurance. The stock exchange, being the important player of the capital market, has a significant role in the Nepalese financial market. Nepal Government, under a program initiated to reform capital markets converted Securities Exchange Center into Nepal Stock Exchange Limited (NEPSE) in 1993^[Securities Exchange Center was established in 1976 with an objective of facilitating and promoting the growth of capital markets. Before conversion into stock exchange it was the only capital markets institution undertaking the job of brokering, underwriting, managing public issue, market making for government bonds and other financial services.]. The NEPSE's primary objective is to impart free marketability and liquidity to the government and corporate securities by facilitating transactions in its trading floor through member, market intermediaries, such as broker, market makers etc. NEPSE opened its trading floor on January 13, 1994. Secondary market transaction of Government bonds commenced at NEPSE on December 15, 2006. The NEPSE introduced fully automated screen based trading since August 24, 2007, replacing the previous open-out-cry system. It facilitates trading in the following instruments: a) shares (equity shares and preference shares), b) debentures, c) government bonds, and d) mutual funds. Further, process has begun to enter more securities brokers into the securities market and make it more competitive as per the provision in the Securities Broker Regulations, 2007. Moreover, the NEPSE has reconstructed its website and has started to include real time information since October 2007.

The Securities Act 2007 came into effect on January 14, 2007. The Act has further broadened the mandate of the Securities Board of Nepal (SEBON) as the regulator of the securities market. The SEBON has introduced Security Board Regulations 2007, Securities Market Operation Regulation 2007, and Securities Dealers Regulation 2007 on November 5, 2007 and Merchant Banker Regulation on March 15, 2008. It has developed Securities Registration and Issue Regulation, 2073.

The insurance sector was opened to the private sector in 1990. There are altogether 40 insurance companies established under Insurance Act, 1992 and Insurance Rules, 2049. 19 of these are life insurance, 20 non-life insurance, and 1 is re-insurance company^[https://nib.gov.np/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Namelist-Insurance-Companies-2077.pdf]. The largely government-controlled National Insurance Corporation is the oldest corporate entity in this sector. The Insurance Board regulates the insurance sector.

### Challenges

- Establishment of banks, financial institutions and insurance companies help develop innovation and entrepreneurship that support long-term economic development. With the development of the financial sector, the challenge is to promote financial stability and discipline. Presently, the issue of ensuring effectiveness, transparency and discipline has also been of concern at the global level. Hence, it is also crucial to maintain financial stability in Nepal. The major challenge lies in enhancing competitiveness, expanding the financial access, and ensuring merger and acquisition besides strengthening systemic efficiency, discipline, and financial consolidation.

- Although recent measures undertaken by the NRB has improved the performance of the financial sector, the sector is still fragile and there is little access to financial services for the small businesses and low-income households. In this context, a recent study has identified two initiatives that the Government could take to help banks increase small business lending: a) develop a technical assistance fund to help potential banks build up suitable products and procedures for profitable lending to small businesses; b) create an enabling environment so that small business lending is safer, cheaper and faster. Similarly, for facilitating microfinance institutions serve a large number of low-income households, two steps could be undertaken by the government. The first one relates to promoting the microfinance industry by upgrading technical skills, reenergizing the sector, and reforming state-owned providers. The second measure concerns the creating of a legal and regulatory environment that protects microfinance consumers and promotes stability.

- With Nepal's membership to the World Trade Organization (WTO), the changes and reforms that the banks and financial institutions have to make are more intricate and challenging. The accession of Nepal to this global organization exemplifies both opportunities and risks in the process of maintaining overall financial stability so as to help accelerate the speed of economic growth. In the long run, it is indispensable for the banking sector to have the financial resources, skills and large-scale commitment to compete with larger competitors that have sophisticated system, capital to handle credit and operational risks.

- The financial services sector (FSS) of Nepal will be completely open for foreign participation after 2010 as per the commitments of FSS liberalization. However, experiences have demonstrated that liberalization coupled with inadequate strengthening of regulatory and supervisory framework, is an open invitation for financial crisis. Hence, the opportunities and threats of liberalization of the financial sector need to be properly accessed. In order to compete at par with foreign financial institutions the Nepalese financial institutions not only needs to upgrade its skills but also its size and reach. The ability to tap right technology becomes increasingly important to meet the more sophisticated demands. As such financial services entities will require large amounts of capital investments to remain competitive and be able to assume higher risks. 

- The country's financial sector has witnessed many changes in the past fostered, in part, by the emergence of new products and new market participants. While new financial products have undoubtedly led to better risk-sharing in the economy, they have also complicated the NRB's task of ensuring systemic stability through financial regulation and supervision. Moreover, due to a rapid increase in the number of banking and non-banking financial institutions with different modes of operations, the task of ensuring adequate monitoring and control by the NRB has been made more challenging.

- The development of credit rating agencies stands out as one of the possible options that would help reduce risk and check the high lending rates charged by financial intermediaries in the country. Equally important, credit rating agencies could help to de-emphasize the high importance attached by financial intermediaries to track records, a requirement that results from mistrust and lack of information about potential borrowers. The setting up of a credit rating agency is also necessary to provide information related to the securities and other market instruments besides contributing to the institutional good governance and practice of professional ratings of the institutions.

- An array of hindrances has restrained capital market development.A central depository system and a scriptless trading platform are prerequisites for an efficient capital market system but have been held up by the lack of an adequate legal framework. Current disclosure levels for listed companies are also weak and need to be supported by the development of a comprehensive set of accounting standards by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nepal. The nascent state of the insurance and pension sectors, and more generally, a limited investor and issuer base are also impediments to the development of the private securities markets.

- Given the present context of lacking the appropriate investment infrastructure for institutional investors, such as the CIT, EPF, and insurance companies, there is a need to promote and manage the issuance of debentures, mutual funds, and unit plans through the stock exchange. Furthermore, to make the capital mobilization activities more professional and transparent, there is a need of clear regulatory measures for these institutions.

- Since the NEPSE is being run under the government ownership and management, it would be difficult for an autonomous regulatory institution to regulate and supervise it. In this context, there is a need to review the ownership and management and develop it as a modern institution operating as per the international practice.

- Given the growing concept of international listing and trading in the South Asian region, it is necessary to strengthen the professional and institutional capability of securities market and brokers. Establishment of a Central Depository System (CDS) is necessary in this regard. This will spread up the securities transfer process. Further, there is a challenge to develop the securities market, to make it a better avenue for NRNs and FIIs.

- Closer links between formal and informal financial markets should be developed by encouraging formal financial institutions to mobilize deposits and allocate credit through informal and community-based banks and microfinance agents in areas where the reach of formal banks is limited. Fiscal policies, as well as regulatory and supervisory structures, should be designed to encourage these developments.

- Capital account liberalization can play a useful role in financial reforms. Opening up to foreign banks and other financial firms and to foreign direct investment in the financial sector has many potential benefits. These benefits include the introduction of financial innovations and sophisticated financial instruments by foreign financial firms, added depth in domestic financial markets due to foreign inflows, and more efficiency in the domestic banking sector through increased competition. The academic literature indicates, however, that precipitous opening of the capital account before the domestic financial sector has reached a certain level of maturity and the appropriate regulatory expertise is in place could spell trouble.

- Action should be taken to build local capabilities in risk management. This encompasses development of trust and policy credibility, as well as governance procedures. Macroeconomic risks can be reduced by pursuing sound macroeconomic policies, improving coordination between fiscal and monetary policies, and careful management of government borrowing. Market risks can be mitigated by improving capital market efficiency, reducing interest rate volatility, developing secondary markets for treasury bills and improving liquidity management. Microeconomic risks can be lowered by improving the accuracy, reliability and timeliness of financial information, enforcing financial contracts, providing efficient and reliable payment systems, risk-sharing and credit risk insurance schemes, and enhancing diversification in small markets. 

- An essential prerequisite of fiscal and monetary control is reliable and timely information on the financial and nonfinancial sectors. Decision-makers in central banks, supervisory agencies, and finance ministries need adequate financial information to monitor and diagnose financial sector problems and to distinguish between illiquidity and insolvency of individual institutions. Similarly, banks and investors need good financial information to assess and monitor the creditworthiness of borrowers and issuers of shares.

- Strong and reliable legal and regulatory frameworks are the foundations upon which policy credibility and financial stability rest. In their absence, economic and financial policies can not be implemented. Legal and regulatory enforcement is needed to ensure action is taken against those that violate their prudential and financial obligations, and to act as a credible deterrent for all market participants.

## Status of financial sector (Economic Survey, 2019-20)

The financial sector has been expanding rapidly in recent years. Access to banking, insurance and capital markets is increasing. The financial system has become more stable and financial instruments have become more productive. Investment is encouraged due to reforms in interest rates on loans. Financial services are being rural oriented and based on information technology. The share of bad loans of financial institutions is the lowest in South Asia. The scope of capital market is also widening with the use of electronic system in transactions.

Due to the effective implementation and improvement of the policy arrangements for the development and consolidation of the financial sector in the last few years, access to finance has been increasing and financial transactions have also expanded significantly.

The banking sector's share has been increasing in the asset/liability structure of Nepal's financial system. By the mid-January 2019, the share of bank and financial institutions to the total assets/liability structure of the financial system is 88.1 percent. In this structure, share of Nepal Rastra Bank is 16.8 percent and that of commercial banks is 57.6 percent. Thus, the ratio of total assets/liabilities of organizations operating in banking sector and contractual savings to GDP is 161.3 percent.

### Financial sector stability

The indicators of financial sector stability in fiscal year 2019/20 are robust in totality. But the ratio of non-performing loan (NPL) of banks and financial institutions has increased to 1.8 percent in mid-January 2020 from 1.5 percent of mid-July 2019.

# Agriculture Development Bank Limited, its status, operation and rural financing system

## Establishment, vision, mission

Agriculture Development Bank (ADB) was established on 21st January 1968 under the Agricultural Development Bank Act, 2024 (1967 AD).

ADB started computerized commercial banking transactions from its Ratnapark branch in Kathmandu in 2041 BS (1984 AB) with the objective of channelizing the resources generated in the urban area in development works in the rural areas. The reform program that the bank introduced voluntarily in 2054 BS (1997 AD) boosted its sustainability. The ABD was put through restructuring process in the second phase under the financial sector reform program that the government initiated with the involvement of the World Bank in 2057 BS (2000 AD) in line with the liberal economic policy the State adopted in 1980s. Accordingly, the bank was registered as a public limited company at the Company Registrar's Office on 15 July, 2005 as per the Company Act, 2053 (1996). It acquired the license for carrying out transactions as a category "A" bank from the Nepal Rastra Bank on 16 March 2006 as per the Banks and Financial Institutions Ordinance, 2062 (2005).

ADBL has now evolved into a bank with the largest working network, highest paid-up capital and the largest number of share members and customers. It has immovable property (land and buildings) worth over Rs. 6 billion and the largest pool of human resources. The bank has also started providing banking services using the sophisticated Core Banking System (T24) information technology.

## Cooperative efforts of ADBL and government and non-governmental organizations for agriculture and MSME credit lending

Commercialization of agriculture sector is crucial for import substitution, export promotion, increasing employment opportunities, attracting youths in agriculture, industrialization, mechanization and discouraging subsistence nature of farming. Also, demand of loan in agriculture sector is increasing every year but, to the dismay, agricultural credit has not increased in-line. Adoption and expanded use of modern capital intensive technology through a smooth flow of credit in agriculture sector could bring commercialization in agriculture.

Nepal government has given top most priority to the development of agricultural sector. Accordingly, Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) has directed commercial banks to increase their exposure in agricultural sector from 10% to 15% in next three years i.e. by Ashad end 2080. Out of the total target of 15% for agricultural sector, banks outstanding exposure should reach 11% of its total credit portfolio by Ashad end 2078. Similarly, through monetary policy of NRB and budget speech of FY 2077/78, government of Nepal has envisioned Agricultural Development Bank Limited to lead in terms of lending in agriculture. In line with the government declaration, ADBL has been issuing _Kisan Credit_ Card to its clients who are enjoying agricultural credits and issuing Agriculture Bond to the commercial banks as well-probably the first time in the history of banking industry in Nepal.

ADBL has been making Memorandum of Understanding and/or extending its nexus with some Governmental bodies and I/NGOs for the promotion of agricultural credit, MSMEs and subsidized loan.

## Small and micro enterprise development program

ADB launched the poverty alleviation campaign through the Small Farmers Development Program (SMDP) since 2032 BS (1975 AD). Until the fiscal year 2053/54 (1996/97), the program's reach extended to 652 VDCs in 75 districts of the country with 422 sub-project offices. The program disbursed Rs 6.49 billion rupees in loan to over 210,000 poor families. In this way, ADB has been successful in maintaining its unique identity in the national and international levels for the contribution it has made in raising the living standards of the poor.

In its efforts towards contributing to the poverty alleviation endeavors, the bank has invested nearly Rs. 14 billion through the SMDP and other prioritized programs while it has provided loans of over Rs. 100 billion to the small and medium entrepreneurs through regular programs. This has been possible with the support and cooperation from government and non-government sectors.

As per a recent Rural Credit Survey, it is estimated that the institutional sector meets only 20% of the demand for credit from the entire rural sector. According to a study carried out by the Asian Development Bank, annually there is a gap of nearly Rs. 13 billion between the demand and supply of rural credit in Nepal. This explicitly shows that credit supply arrangements have not been able to meet the demand for the same in the rural areas. The gap between the demand and supply of credit has widened further in the rural areas as credit providers, especially the commercial banks, were limited to the district headquarters in the past due to conflict. In this backdrop, SMEs play vital role in creation of employment opportunities, poverty reduction and economic growth of the country. According to survey of Small Manufacturing Establishments 2000, there are altogether 43671 establishments in operation and total number of persons engaged is 121270. In FY 2007/08, employment in SMEs sector reached to 299557. It shows that there is significant contribution of SME sector in Nepal.

ADBL has invested a large chunk of the loans pumped into the poverty alleviation sector which is the priority sector of the Government of Nepal. Similarly, under the regular program, the bank has issued nearly 85% of its total credit outflow to the small and medium entrepreneurs. ADBL has been conducting training programs for enhancing the capacity of the entrepreneurs, operating the group saving program for increasing the community capital, and carrying out the infrastructure development works for the development of the rural economy. It is found that the loans issued to the small and micro enterprises has helped in generating employment and made a positive impact on the bank's financial health.

The rich experience that the bank has gathered should be used for increasing the income level and sustenance of the lower and middle class communities living in the rural and urban areas of country through the promotion of enterprises and businesses that yield profit in short time. With the GoN prioritizing the programs aimed for raising the living standards of the people in rural areas, development of small and micro enterprises and to develop adequate knowledge, skills and capacity on running business among the entrepreneurs and business persons, special priority designation by the GoN, ABDL started Small and Micro Enterprise Development Program since FY 1997/98. The overall goal of the program is to create self-employment in the rural and urban areas so as to contribute to the national economy.

**Operational procedure and structure**

Under the programs operated through the Small and Micro Enterprises Development Program, loans of up to one million rupees are disbursed per customer/project from the bank or institutional credit to the low-income farmers living in the rural and urban areas who are setting up enterprises with a potential of giving returns in short time and that utilize the labor, skills and capability of the entrepreneurs themselves.

The bank disburse two types of loans -- wholesale and individual -- under this program. People of the economically disadvantaged classes and micro-entrepreneurs will be the ones carrying out the transactions related to loans on a retail basis while the development banks, financial institutions, self-help groups, organizations/institutions and voluntary groups would be the ones borrowing out wholesale loans to disburse the same to small and micro entrepreneurs.

The bank issues loans of upto Rs. 800,000 to the small and micro-enrepreneurs carrying out transactions with the bank on individual basis under the condition that they will have to make 20% investment themselves. This loan would be of short and medium term and the interest rate would be as determined by the bank from time to time. The entrepreneur concerned should fill up the loan requisition form available at the bank while applying for this type of loan and deposit the required documents and collateral as per the bank regulations.

If the development banks and financial institutions, associations/organizations and groups ask for loans from the bank in order to disburse loans to their small and micro-entreprise clientele, or members, the bank may provide the SME wholesale loan, also called financial intermediary loans, to them. Loans thus provided extend upto,

- Rs. 50 million for development bank
- Rs. 10 million for financial institution
- Rs. 2.5 million for group

The agencies taking this loan, while themselves disbursing loans to their customer, can disburse a maximum of Rs. 800,000 per customer. The loan disbursed under this heading would be of short term while the rate of interest would be as fixed by the bank. The BFIs, in addition to having have fulfilled minimum banking/financing standards should submit all the required documents for loan requisition, and also should deposit the required collateral/surety.

**Services provided by the program**

- Training on skill, capacity and efficiency enhancement to entrepreneurs, banks and financial institutions, employees and office-bearers of associations/institutions, and the SMEs tying up with the program.
- Taking of the social responsibility, bank provides support with grant assistance from government to clubs and community organization for construction of water taps, toilets, passengers' waiting sheds, resting places, schools and hospitals, temples and religious shrines, traffic island and community buildings, and also road repair and projects directly benefiting the society.

**Programs run with government grants**

- Livestock Security (Insurance) Program
- Crop Security (Insurance) Program

**Micro Cottage and Small Industries Credit Program**

Loans for running enterprises and business disbursed to the persons who have received skill and entrepreneurship development training under the micro enterprises development program implemented by the central and district level offices under the Department of Micro, Cottage and Small Industries and the Cottage and Small Industries Development Committee (two offices also recommend for loan disbursement) and the Micro Enterprises Development Program operated under the Ministry of Industry with domestic and foreign cooperation.

Under this scheme, maximum loan of upto Rs. 60,000 per member is issued to groups comprising minimum of five members and maximum of 11 members. The loans are issued under collective guarantee (collateral).

**Youth and Small Entrepreneurs Self-Employment Program**

- Provision of providing maximum periodic collateral-free loan of Rs. 200,000 per person to the entrepreneurs who have received training.
- On recommendation of district-based mechanism to unemployed but skilled human resources.
- Issued at concessional interest rate with the objective of utilizing the productive labor force in the country.




## Necessity and status of international support to ADBL

Cooperative Bank was established in 1963 to provide wholesale credit to cooperatives that further provided retail credit to its members. Agriculture credit was not accessible during that time. In other words, there was no direct financing system for individual farmers/agri-entrepreneurs. Thus, national and international community realized the need of a bank for rural and agriculture lending. Consequently, on the request of USAID, Government of Nepal established, "Agricultural Development Bank/Nepal" (ADB/N) on 1968 (Magh 7th 2024). Bank's central infrastructures, branch office networks, outreach and volume of credit has gradually increased with the support of Government and international communities since then.

### Assisted network and business expansion

**Asian Development Bank (ADB)**

ADB is the primary international financial institution supporting ADBN/ADBL through its line of agricultural credit (up to six agricultural credit projects continued for almost 30 years,  and grant and technical assistance for about 40 years). ADB has contributed significantly for expansion, strengthening, restructuring and modernization of this bank.

- First agricultural credit was initiated in 19701 (also the first agricultural credit of ADB in this region)
- Supported managing resources for all types of agricultural credit like cereal, cash crop, plantation crop, horticulture, livestock, aquaculture, irrigation (tube-wells, pump-sets, dug-well), micro-hydro, alternate energy, farm mechanization, agro processing (sugarcane, tea, coffee, milk, fruits, mills, cottage industry ), cold storage, warehousing and related others.
- Supported management & capacity building of staffs: management of agriculture technical staffs (loan officer/loan assistant, Irrigation Engineer/overseer, renewable energy technician), capacity building both domestic and international, international exposure
- Development of loan product paper, loan manual, loan processing documents, loan collection process
- Supported Small Farmers Development Program with 3rd SFDP credit from 1989
- Supported bank for its diagnostic review and restructure with Rural Finance Sector Development Cluster Program (RFSDCP) Phase I & II.
- Supported SKBBL for its diagnostic review, restructuring and provided seed money for expansion of business

**International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)**

- IFAD supported bank from initiation of SFDP in 1975 mainly for pilot testing of SFDP, capacity building of small farmers and SFDP related staffs
- Initiation of regional small farmers training center in all 5 regions (Mangalapur, Birendranagar, Letang, Nepalgunj/Pipari and Dhangadhi) and central training institute (Agriculture Credit Training and Research Institute, ACTRI)
- Soft loan as SFDP-I (1980-1987) & SFDP-II (1986-1991) for expansion of SFDP and access to finance
- Expansion of SFDP and access of credit to small farmers
- Under the Second Small Farmer Development Project (SFDP II), the assistance given to small farmer groups (SFGs) was extended to 43 districts. SFDP II eligibility criteria was designed only with a per capita income threshold of Rs 1200 at 1978/79 prices (USD 70).
- Loan used for: (i) crop production, livestock, minor irrigation works, horticulture and village industry/agro-processing; and (ii) service activities, necessary for effective project implementation, comprising training, technical assistance, monitoring and evaluation, and support for the salaries of additional Agricultural Development Bank of Nepal (ADBN) staff (group organizers -GOs-, assistant group organizers -AGOs-, etc.) involved.
- Soft loan and capacity building for successful implementation of "Production Credit for Rural
Women Project" (PCRW)
- Soft loan and capacity building for successful implementation of Hills Leasehold Forestry and Forage Development Project
- Aquaculture Development Project
- Capacity building support for "Financial Service Access Project" through APRACA, Bangkok
- Recently grant support of US$ 1.2 million is approved mainly for "Kisan Credit Card/Apps" under Rural Poor Stimulus Fund
- Value Chains for Inclusive Transformation of Agriculture (VITA) project is on pipeline (line of credit US$ 80.3 million for 35 years)

### Reasons for technical and grant assistance needs

1. To decrease the cost of capital

- Currently, there is no any long term soft loan and bank has to depend on high cost deposit resulting in higher cost of capital. This is one of the major factors for higher base rate i.e. around 8.8%.
- Around one-third of bank loan portfolio is in agriculture, for which interest rate is just around breakeven rate resulting in low income on one hand, and on other that creates hurdle to retain large size prime customers.

2. To increase large size loan project

Out of total loan borrowers, 88% borrowers are concentrated within the loan size of NPR.1.5 million which is around half of the average loan size of other commercial banks. This is one of the vital reasons for higher operating cost as transaction cost (pre loan supervision, inspection, documentation, follow-up, monitoring, collection, IT expenses) of lending is much higher. Large size loan helps in reducing the operating cost, therefore, long-term soft loan is needed to attract large size projects.

3. To minimize mismatch of resources

Repayment period of plantation crop (tea, coffee, fruits), agri-business (cow, buffaloes, goats, dairy industry, fishery, poultry), cold storage, warehousing, farm machinery is more than 12 months, around 5 yrs to 10 yrs and even more for tea, coffee and fruit trees. Maturity period of around 90% deposit is within 12 months. It is risky to disburse these types of deposit for medium and long term loan. Therefore, there is mismatch of resources for term loan.

4. Strengthen role of bank in agriculture lending

There is huge gap in access to credit in general and access to agricultural credit in particular. Out of total loan portfolio of banks, share of agricultural portfolio is just around 6%, and there is big gap of NPR 148.5 billion. At interest rate of 11%, the gap will double considering 15% portfolio in agriculture. This is one of the reasons why agriculture import is in increasing trend besides many efforts of its reversal. Moreover, agriculture portfolio is not considered as attractive business for many private sector banks. They are lacking agriculture lending professional staffs. Therefore, Government of Nepal has considered ADBL as the lead bank for agriculture lending considering its nationwide network, capacity, long experiences in agriculture lending, well equipped training centers, long relationship with international donors for agriculture lending, large outreach, and well known brand in agriculture lending. It's tough to fulfill the responsibility by managing high cost deposit from the competitive market. Thus ADBL needs long term soft loan to fulfill the huge gap gradually maintaining its sound financial health and with good return to the shareholders.

5. Issuing Agriculture Bond/Green Bond

ADBL plans to issue Agriculture bond in near future. Thus, International experiences, expertise, technical assistance & grant support will be highly useful in planning, appraisal & implementation of "Agriculture Bond & Green Bond"

6.	 Agri-business Incubation Center & Strengthening of training centers

ADBL training centers will be serving as Agri-business incubation center as well. So to enhance the capacity of the training centers as incubation center and enrich employee’s ability, International experiences, expertise, technical assistance & grant support will be highly useful.

7. Retention and attraction of prime customers
8. Support in repayment of installments
9. Transfer of technology: international donors support bank with professional experts, replicate best tested international banking technology/practice in modern digital banking, automation of loan process and many more, capacity building of staffs and entrepreneurs.
10. International branding/image: Only eligible and high performing institution is getting international support, thus it will enhance ADBL image in international financing market
11. Improve in working culture
12. Development of new products/services
13. Increase both outreach and profit and dividend to shareholders

### Support of ADB besides line of credit

Bank has achieved significant progress during the restructuring period of 8 years. Among others shifting in operational profit from more than 8 billion loss; providing dividend to shareholders; being the highest tax payer among banking sector for 2 years and transformation from development to commercial bank were few commendable achievement. Moreover, this program was awarded as the outstanding program from Asian Development Bank. A brief summary of achievements are as follows,

1. Capital Restructuring

Capital adequacy was negative by 16.1% and 15.5% in FY 2060/61 and 2061/62 respectively and it has gradually improved. It was 20.5% in last fiscal year 2076/7.

ii. Organization Restructuring

Introduce right-sizing concept

a) Rationalization, review an assessment criteria and use criteria to classify branches
b) Support average branches to expand business to reach higher level
c) Introduce criteria for decision on new branch openings with emphasis on market and viability

Agriculture & rural credit disbursement was the main function of ADBN before its restructuring. Main sources of fund were ADB soft loan and deposit collection from urban area through limited banking. Therefore, up to 2069/70, volume of outstanding loan was more than deposit. ADBL initiated banking activities in remaining branches based on their potentiality and deposit amount slightly increased more than loan from 2070/71.
a. Development & Implementation of ADBL Business plan
b. Branch Refurbishing: Many branches were gradually refurbished. Corporate design, color and minimum standard were defined and implemented
c. Profit orientation: Operation in operating profit from loss
  i. Re-launched profit center concept through awareness (regional level awareness programs/internal meetings)
  ii. Outlet Closure/Merger on the basis of business and profit orientation
  iii. Reviewed existing performance measurement indicator for profit centers; NPL of ADBN was at alarming stage i.e. 47% in fiscal year 2059/60 as per diagnostic report of the ADB review team. It decreased gradually, staying at 2.7% in the last fiscal year. Orientation toward quality lending, maintaining quality loan portfolio, risk analysis and profit orientation are the few reasons among others for this achievement.

d. Development of new products and services
e. Human resource management
f. Initial public offering (IPO) issuance
g. Technology transformation

Main components of restructuring include IT and MIS upgrading and establishment of Core Banking System (CBS). ADB supported ADBN in establishment of modern T24 CBS with around US$ 10 million grant support, technical IT professional for gradual expansion in all branches, grant for annual maintenance cost, national & international training (from India, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore) for development of IT professional.

h. Strengthening of training centers by establishing computer training labs and financial support for implementation of training mainly for CBS, business operation, treasury and trade finance and digital banking.

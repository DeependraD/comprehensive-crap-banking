### Management Information System 

MIS is the study of people, technology, organizations and the relationships among them. MIS professionals helps firms realize maximum benefit from investment in personal, equipment, and business processes. MIS is a people-oriented field with an emphasis on service delivery through the use of technology for decision-making, coordination, control, analysis, and visualization of information in an organization.

Business use information systems at all levels of operation to collect, process and store data. Management aggregates and disseminates this data in the form of information needed to carry out the daily operations of business. Everyone who works in business, from someone who pays the bills to the person who makes employment decision, uses information system.

In public governance, MIS are the tools to promote transparency, accountability and participation. More specifically, recent approaches to delivering bureaucratic services are expected to meet their goals of public orientation and result based performance evaluation aided through information system. Establishment of computerized Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) is being mulled over to implement single platform central accounting system as a part of a public finance management reform initiative by Government of Nepal with support of World Bank. For example, under this system information about expenditure made by the Department of Roads and the revenue collected by the Inland Revenue Department will be disseminated via the same platform. Also the concept of digital National Identity Card based is a part of broader vision of government, currently under delegation of the National ID Management Center (NIDMC) under aegis of Ministry of Home Affairs, to aggregate vital information database of the citizens.

In a corporate setting, the ultimate goal of the use of a management information system is to increase the value and profits of the business. This is done by providing managers with timely and appropriate information allowing them to make effective decisions within a shorter period of time.

3. Flexibility

  - Strategic planning must allow for adjustments for unanticipated threats and opportunities and managers must make modifications in controlling methods, techniques and systems.
4. Acceptability

While management information systems can be used by any and every level of management, the decision of which systems to implement generally falls upon the chief information officers (CIO) and chief technology officers (CTO). These officers are generally responsible for the overall technology strategy of an organization including evaluating how new technology can help their organization. Once decisions have been made, IT directors, including MIS directors, are in charge of the technical implementation of the system. Upon implementation, the assigned users will have the appropriate access to relevant information. It is important to note that not everyone inputting data into MIS need necessarily be management level.

In banking and finance, the MIS represents the electronic automation of several different kinds of counting, tallying, record-keeping, and accounting techniques, of which the by-far oldest was the ledger on which the business owner kept track of his or her business. More recently, the role of MIS in public and private governance and banking is further invigorated by widespread networking facilities made possible through internet.

### Development of human resource management in Nepal

Nepal may not be in the pace with other developing countries in terms of its human resource management but has definitely come a long way. In 1980s with the entry of some foreign joint venture banks and companies the concept of HR Management seems to arise as these companies had structured HR processes, from recruitment to employees' grievance handling. Further with the arrival of more Joint Ventures and INGO in Nepal the HR Management terms gained momentum. These organizations were successful in inspiring other Nepalese business organization with their effective employee management. In Nepalese Institutions HR department as such did not exist in the form of a separate body till 2000 A.D. Human resource department function was combined with the administrative department and this department carried out the role of human resource departments. Moreover, HR function was limited to carrying out routine activities such as, record keeping, updating the payroll and maintaining relations with employees. Majority of organizations didn't involve their human resource heads in the formulation of strategy, decision making and business planning process. Vital decisions related to employees were taken by executives without consulting the human resource managers. But then, regulation of Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) for all commercial banks to have a mandatory separate HR department was the start of prudent HR practices in BFIs. Then after, efficient HR management in BFIs was among the core objectives of reform programs including Financial Sector Strategy Statement (2000) and Financial Sector Reform Program (2004).

# Banking services

Traditionally banking services/banking products have been deposits (saving account, current account and term saving account) and credit (cash credit and term loans).

Banks accept deposit at specified rates, fixed by the Central Bank, and lend amount that arrived by the formula, also prescribed by the Central Bank. Prime lending rate (PLR) was the benchmark for interest on the lending products. But PLR itself was mostly dictated by the Central Bank.

Remittances products were limited to demand drafts, telegraphic transfers, bankers cheque and internal transfer of funds.

As part of economic reforms that began around 1990s, banking industry is now subject to less stringent control and has been made more competitive. New players have been added to the competition. The IT revolution has made it possible to provide ease and flexibility in operations to customers. A surge in use of internet based services have prompted both individuals and corporate to demand better services with more products. As a consequence, bank's financial market has turned into a buyer's market.

Banks are also changing with time and are trying to become one-stop financial supermarkets. By offering multiple products for all kinds of customers, market focus is shifting from mass banking products to class banking with introduction of value added and customized products. Futuristic banking institutions are making use of new product distribution channels, as more and more banks are outsourcing services such as disbursement and servicing of consumer loans, credit card businesses.

Home/individual banking has become common with a preference for products like cheque deposit and withdrawal, ATM card, debit card, credit card, mobile and internet banking. Various deposit and credit schemes are dispensed by banks over a number of in-person, mobile and internet channels such as saving and fixed deposits, and personal loans including consumer loans, housing loans and vehicle loans.

Corporate are deriving great benefit from the increased variety of products and competition among banks too. Certificates of deposit, commercial papers, ?Non-Convertible Debentures (CDs) that can be traded in the secondary market are gaining popularity.

### SWIFT

The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) operates a worldwide financial messaging network. The swift network exchanges message securely and reliably between banks and other financial institutions. It also markets software and services to financial institutions, much of it for use on the SWIFT Net network and the ISO 9362 bank identifier code which are popularly known as SWIFT codes.

SWIFT is a cooperative society under Belgian law, with its current headquarters located in La Hulpe, near Brussels, and is owned by its member financial institutions. It was founded in Brussels in 1973, supported by 239 banks in 15 countries. It started to establish common standards for financial transactions, and shared data processing system and worldwide communications network. Fundamental operating procedures, rules for liability, etc. were established in 1975, and the first message was sent in 1977. Currently, 90% of all banks worldwide use the SWIFT network to carry out international bank transfers.

SWIFT provides turn-key solutions for members consisting of linkage clients to facilitate connectivity to the SWIFT Net and computer-based terminals (CBTs) which members use to manage the delivery and receipt of their message. Some of the more well-known CBTs include are, SWIFT Net Link (SNL), SWIFT Alliance Access/Entry (SAA/SAE), SWIFT Alliance Workstation (SAW), SWIFT Alliance Gateway (SAG), SWIFT Alliance Messenger (SAM), etc.

SWIFT also offers a secure person-to-person messaging service called SWIFTNet Mail intented for the secure transfer of sensitive business documents such as invoices, as well as security-sensitive data over the open internet.

SWIFT moved to its current IP Network infrastructures SWIFT Net in 2003, providing a total replacement of the previous X.25 infrastructure. The process involved development of new protocols that facilitate efficient messaging, using existing and new message standards (uses XML).

There are four key areas that SWIFT services fall under within the financial marketplace: securities, treasury and derivatives, trade services and payments, and cash management. Basically, SWIFT provides a centralized store-and-forward mechanism with some transaction management.




### Debit card

### Credit card

A credit card is a system of payment named after the small plastic card issued to users of the system. It is different from a debit card in that it does not remove money from the user's account after every transaction. In the case of credi cards, the issuer lends money to the customer (or the user) to be paid to the merchant. A credit card allows the consumer to "revolve" their balance at the cost of having interest charged.

A user is issued credit card after an account has been approved by the credit provider, and is given a credit card with which the user will be able to make purchases from merchants accepting the credit card up to a pre-established credit limit. When purchase is made, the credit user agrees to pay the card issuer. The cardholder indicates their consent to pay by signing a receipt with a record of the card details and indicating the amount to be paid or by entering a PIN. Also, some merchants may accept verbal authorization via telephone and electronic authorization using the internet, known as a card not present (CNP) transaction.

Credit card issuers usually waive interest charges if the balance is paid in full each month, but typically will charge full interest on the entire outstanding balance from the date of each purchase if the total balance is not paid.



### ATM

Most banks issue Automated Teller Machine (ATM) cards to their depositors for easy withdrawal of money from their accounts. An ATM card is a magnetic card which can be operated on a ATM by using a particular set of secret number, also known as Personal Identification Number (PIN). It is one of the most convenient and accessible systems of withdrawal of money.

When a card holder wants to withdraw or _deposit_ money, first he has to establish his identity at the teller by entering his PIN. All relevant details, including PIN, such as type of bank account to make withdrawal or deposit from and the sum of such money are entered, following the instruction given by the machine, either using keyboard or touch sensitive screen.

For cash deposit, the cash is required to be kept in a special envelope, which is available at the ATM counter. After sealing and writing the necessary information on it, the envelope placed near a slit is entered into the machine upon selecting the deposit option from the input. The bank officials will collect those envelopes at regular interval and credit the amount in the respective accounts.

To facilitate quick transaction, banks provide the following teller counters to withdraw money from the deposit account.

1. Manual teller counter

In manual teller counters, banks generally allow withdrawal of money from the savings account for amount up to a limit. The cheque or withdrawal form is presented at the counter, and payment is made after verifying the balance in the account and tallying the specimen signature of the account holder.

2. Automatic teller counter

In automatic teller counter, ATMs are installed to handle cash transactions 24 hours a day. There is no need of anybody to verify your balance, compare the specimen signature or hand over or take over the cash.

Nepalese banks are providing electronic cards and ATM services to their customers and also to the customers of other banks, which are in relation with it by provision of agreement. Under this service, banks not only issue the cards, they also accept the cards of other banking companies, both domestic and foreign, and establish and operate an numerous ATM counter at different locations to deliver quick withdrawl/deposit service to customers.

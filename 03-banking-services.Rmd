# Banking services

Traditionally banking services/banking products have been deposits (saving account, current account and term saving account) and credit (cash credit and term loans).

Banks accept deposit at specified rates, fixed by the Central Bank, and lend amount that arrived by the formula, also prescribed by the Central Bank. Prime lending rate (PLR) was the benchmark for interest on the lending products. But PLR itself was mostly dictated by the Central Bank.

Remittances products were limited to demand drafts, telegraphic transfers, bankers cheque and internal transfer of funds.

As part of economic reforms that began around 1990s, banking industry is now subject to less stringent control and has been made more competitive. New players have been added to the competition. The IT revolution has made it possible to provide ease and flexibility in operations to customers. A surge in use of internet based services have prompted both individuals and corporate to demand better services with more products. As a consequence, bank's financial market has turned into a buyer's market.

Banks are also changing with time and are trying to become one-stop financial supermarkets. By offering multiple products for all kinds of customers, market focus is shifting from mass banking products to class banking with introduction of value added and customized products. Futuristic banking institutions are making use of new product distribution channels, as more and more banks are outsourcing services such as disbursement and servicing of consumer loans, credit card businesses.

Home/individual banking has become common with a preference for products like cheque deposit and withdrawal, ATM card, debit card, credit card, mobile and internet banking. Various deposit and credit schemes are dispensed by banks over a number of in-person, mobile and internet channels such as saving and fixed deposits, and personal loans including consumer loans, housing loans and vehicle loans.

Corporate are deriving great benefit from the increased variety of products and competition among banks too. Certificates of deposit, commercial papers, ?Non-Convertible Debentures (CDs) that can be traded in the secondary market are gaining popularity.

## Deposit

Deposit products refer to the variety of ways banks collect deposits from public. Some of the important deposit products with their features are discussed below.

1. Savings bank account

- Promote the habit of saving among citizens while allowing them to use their funds when required
- Benefit is derived from high liquidity, security and interest accrued
- Interest rate is decided and periodically reviewed by the GoN

2. Current bank account

- Primarily meant for businessmen, firms, companies and public enterprises that have high transaction volume
- Generally cheque-operated and meant for convenience purpose
- Do not bear interest on the deposits

3. Demand deposit

- Funds held in deposit funds, where money is legally able to be withdrawn immediately upon demand
- Allows immediate conversion of the account balance into cash or transfer to another account

4. Term deposit

- Held at financial institution for a fixed term, generally short term
- Maturity period ranges from months to few years
- Deposit money can only be withdrawn upon the end of the term or by pre-notifying the bank for special withdrawl case
- Safe, and therefore appealing to conservative, low-risk investors

5. Certificate of deposit/CD

- Time deposit commonly offered to consumers by banks, thrift institutions and credit unions
- Alike savings account, they are insured and thus virtually risk free.
- Unlike saving account, they have a specific, fixed term (often 3/6 months or 1 to 5 years), and has a fixed interest rate.
- Held until maturity, at which time the money may be withdrawn together with the accrued interest.

## Credit

### Loan

The act of giving money, property or other material goods to another party in exchange for future repayment of the principal amount along with interest or other financial charges. A loan may be for a specific, one-time amount or can be available as open-ended credit up to a specified ceiling amount. Loans can be classified as secured and unsecured.

**1. Secured loans**

A secured loan is a loan in which the borrower pledges some asset (e.g., a car or property) as collateral for the loan, which then becomes a secured debt owed to the creditor who gives the loan. The debt is thus secured against the collateral -- in the even that the borrower defaults, the creditor takes possession of the asset used as collateral and may sell it to regain some or all of the amount originally lent to the borrower. If the sale of the collateral does not raise enough money to pay off the debt, the creditor can often obtain a deficiency judgement against the borrower for the remaining amount.

A mortgage loan is a very common type of debt instrument, used to purchase real estate. Under this arrangement, the money is used to purchase the property. Commercial banks, however, are given security -- a lien on the title to the house -- until the mortgage is paid off in full. If the borrower defaults on the loan, the bank would have the legal right to repossess the house and sell it, to recover the sums owing to it.

**2. Unsecured loans**

Unsecured loans are monetary loans that are not secured against the borrower's assets (no collateral is involved). There are small business unsecured loans such as credit cards and credit lines to large corporate credit lines. These may be available from financial institutions under many different guises or marketing packages such as

- Bank overdrafts
- Corporate bonds
- Credit card debt
- Credit facilities or lines of credit
- Personal loans

A *corporate bond* is a bond issued by a corporation. It is a bond that a corporation issues to raise money in order to expand its business. The term is usually applied to longer-term debt instruments, generally with a maturity date falling at least a year after their issue date. The term 'commercial paper' is sometimes used for instruments with a shorter maturity. Sometimes, the term 'corporate bonds' is used to include all bonds except those issued by governments in their own currencies.

According to the type of activity being financed, bank loans can be classified as,

**1. Priority sector lending**

The Government of Nepal through the instrument of NRB mandates certain types of lending on the banks operating in Nepal irrespective of their origin. NRB sets targets in terms of percentage (of total money lent by the banks) to be lent to certain sectors which, in its perception, would not have access to organized lending is called priority sector lending. Financing of small scale industry, small business, agricultural activities and export activities fall under this category. This is also called directed credit in Nepalese banking system.

Financing priority sector in the economy is not strictly on a commercial basis because of the liberal general approach and the less rate of interest charged on such loans. Export finance is, in fact, available at a discount of 20% or more on the normal rate of interest to corporate in Nepal. Part of the cost of this concession is borne by NRB by means of refinancing such loans as a concessional rate. Banks, therefore, contribute towards economic development by subsidizing the business activities undertaken by entrepreneurs in the areas which are considered "priority sector" by NRB.

**2. Commercial lending**

Commercial lending is the mainstay of banking -- its bread and butter activity. Although historically, this activity had been relegated to a secondary position, as banks were driven by the desire to excel themselves in what is known as priority sector banking, yet it is this part of the loan portfolio which has kept them afloat and help meet the costs. With financial sector reforms, the focus has shifted from priority sector banking, and commercial lending has been reinstated as primary vehicle for improving their bottom lines. Fresh and innovative products are being launched to facilitate the corporate customer who forms the core of this business. There is big competition among the banks to secure bigger share of this business.

At present, commercial loans are available for practically any kind of activity and also for both long and short tenures. Based on customer profile, these loans are of three types;

a. Corporate loans
- Meant for corporate bodies (proprietorship, partnerships, etc.) engaged in legal activity for making profit.
- Lending is based on the strength of balance sheet, the length of cash cycle and depending upon the products available with individual banks.
- Steps
  - Audited balance sheets of prospective borrowers are analyzed to appraise their needs and their capacity to absorb credit.
  - Prospective borrowers are required to furnish their financial details in the form of Credit Monitoring Arragement (CMA) data to the bankers, and file an application for the loan.
  - The application is processed and the borrower is asked to execute bank's standard documents, surrender the security or title to the security to the bank and open suitable accounts (mostly cash credit account).
  - Finally, the borrower can operate these accounts within the limit (line of credit).

b. Retail loans
- Meant for small entrepreneurs as well as individuals who are engaged in gainful commercial activity and have the capacity to repay the loan.
- Loans are given on the strength of the means of the borrower with an eye on the repaying capacity, the latter is judged through the cash streams (income) available with the borrower for repayment of the loan.

c. Other specific loans
- Real estate loans
- Financial institution loans
- Agricultural loans
- Commercial and industrial loans
- Loans to individuals
- Miscellaneous loans
- Lease financing receivables

### SWIFT

The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) operates a worldwide financial messaging network. The swift network exchanges message securely and reliably between banks and other financial institutions. It also markets software and services to financial institutions, much of it for use on the SWIFT Net network and the ISO 9362 bank identifier code which are popularly known as SWIFT codes.

SWIFT is a cooperative society under Belgian law, with its current headquarters located in La Hulpe, near Brussels, and is owned by its member financial institutions. It was founded in Brussels in 1973, supported by 239 banks in 15 countries. It started to establish common standards for financial transactions, and shared data processing system and worldwide communications network. Fundamental operating procedures, rules for liability, etc. were established in 1975, and the first message was sent in 1977. Currently, 90% of all banks worldwide use the SWIFT network to carry out international bank transfers.

SWIFT provides turn-key solutions for members consisting of linkage clients to facilitate connectivity to the SWIFT Net and computer-based terminals (CBTs) which members use to manage the delivery and receipt of their message. Some of the more well-known CBTs include are, SWIFT Net Link (SNL), SWIFT Alliance Access/Entry (SAA/SAE), SWIFT Alliance Workstation (SAW), SWIFT Alliance Gateway (SAG), SWIFT Alliance Messenger (SAM), etc.

SWIFT also offers a secure person-to-person messaging service called SWIFTNet Mail intented for the secure transfer of sensitive business documents such as invoices, as well as security-sensitive data over the open internet.

SWIFT moved to its current IP Network infrastructures SWIFT Net in 2003, providing a total replacement of the previous X.25 infrastructure. The process involved development of new protocols that facilitate efficient messaging, using existing and new message standards (uses XML).

There are four key areas that SWIFT services fall under within the financial marketplace: securities, treasury and derivatives, trade services and payments, and cash management. Basically, SWIFT provides a centralized store-and-forward mechanism with some transaction management.




### Debit card

### Credit card

A credit card is a system of payment named after the small plastic card issued to users of the system. It is different from a debit card in that it does not remove money from the user's account after every transaction. In the case of credi cards, the issuer lends money to the customer (or the user) to be paid to the merchant. A credit card allows the consumer to "revolve" their balance at the cost of having interest charged.

A user is issued credit card after an account has been approved by the credit provider, and is given a credit card with which the user will be able to make purchases from merchants accepting the credit card up to a pre-established credit limit. When purchase is made, the credit user agrees to pay the card issuer. The cardholder indicates their consent to pay by signing a receipt with a record of the card details and indicating the amount to be paid or by entering a PIN. Also, some merchants may accept verbal authorization via telephone and electronic authorization using the internet, known as a card not present (CNP) transaction.

Credit card issuers usually waive interest charges if the balance is paid in full each month, but typically will charge full interest on the entire outstanding balance from the date of each purchase if the total balance is not paid.



### ATM

Most banks issue Automated Teller Machine (ATM) cards to their depositors for easy withdrawal of money from their accounts. An ATM card is a magnetic card which can be operated on a ATM by using a particular set of secret number, also known as Personal Identification Number (PIN). It is one of the most convenient and accessible systems of withdrawal of money.

When a card holder wants to withdraw or _deposit_ money, first he has to establish his identity at the teller by entering his PIN. All relevant details, including PIN, such as type of bank account to make withdrawal or deposit from and the sum of such money are entered, following the instruction given by the machine, either using keyboard or touch sensitive screen.

For cash deposit, the cash is required to be kept in a special envelope, which is available at the ATM counter. After sealing and writing the necessary information on it, the envelope placed near a slit is entered into the machine upon selecting the deposit option from the input. The bank officials will collect those envelopes at regular interval and credit the amount in the respective accounts.

To facilitate quick transaction, banks provide the following teller counters to withdraw money from the deposit account.

1. Manual teller counter

In manual teller counters, banks generally allow withdrawal of money from the savings account for amount up to a limit. The cheque or withdrawal form is presented at the counter, and payment is made after verifying the balance in the account and tallying the specimen signature of the account holder.

2. Automatic teller counter

In automatic teller counter, ATMs are installed to handle cash transactions 24 hours a day. There is no need of anybody to verify your balance, compare the specimen signature or hand over or take over the cash.

Nepalese banks are providing electronic cards and ATM services to their customers and also to the customers of other banks, which are in relation with it by provision of agreement. Under this service, banks not only issue the cards, they also accept the cards of other banking companies, both domestic and foreign, and establish and operate an numerous ATM counter at different locations to deliver quick withdrawl/deposit service to customers.

### Financial literacy

The grandiose of development discourse goes beyond basic ideas of focus on poverty, justice, progress, growth, participation and empowerment. While development is the path to attainment of empowerment, the means to it is often vaguely defined; sometimes as freedom from social hurdles and other times as fair distribution of roles and responsibilities along with resources. A major holdout in development discourse is the economic and financial sphere.

Financial literacy refers to "Knowledge and understanding of financial concepts and risks, and the skills as well as motivation and confidence to apply such knowledge and understanding in order to make effective decisions across a range of financial contexts, to improve the financial well-being of individuals and society, and to enable participation in economic life" (OECD, 2015).

The Government of Nepal (GoN) has emphasized the necessity of an inclusive financial system, which is reflected in the 2017 release of Nepal's Financial Sector Development Strategy Paper and has an objective "to develop an inclusive financial system to make access to finance easy and comfortable for those with low income and from rural areas and to increase financial literacy in financial services and instruments and to protect the interests of financial consumers" (FSDS, 2017) in order to achieve its domestic poverty reduction goal.

In consonance with GoN's declaration for an inclusive financial system, Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), the central bank of Nepal, has the objective in NRB Act, 2002 Section 4 (b) "To increase the access of the financial service and increase the public confidence towards the banking and financial system".

To support the attainment of this objective, NRB has highlighted this in its recent Strategic Plan (2017 – 2021) under strategy 2.1 of seventh pillar entitled "Enhancing financial literacy and financial education", in annual monetary policy statements as well as in the Financial Inclusion Roadmap (2017-2022), which provides an overarching guideline for the strengthening of financial inclusion in Nepal, including financial literacy as an intervention to achieve its implementation priority in the area of strengthening consumer empowerment, protection and education.

Financial literacy (FL) programs in Nepal are presently being conducted by various agencies including the central bank in a scattered and fragmented manner with differences in the methodologies and delivery mechanism. Nepal Rastra Bank aims to enhance and systematize the current fragmented FL activities to facilitate monitoring and evaluation as well as regular assessment through a policy initiation in the form of a Financial Literacy Framework (FLF). NRB aims to develop a structured and systematic FLF that will comprise of operating guidelines, training manuals and monitoring and evaluation methodologies based on a standard foundation comprising of NRB's vision, mission, goals and objectives for the FL.

With the current infrastructure and politico-physical landscape, key opportunities of enhancing Financial Literacy lies in moving in tandem with the improving trend of financial access by the presence of BFIs in all local units of the government. This campaign could be further backed by a strong commitment from the government and the central bank.

Financial literacy aims to ultimately enhance knowledge of using banking channels for making financial transactions and converting these skills into behavioral changes. Its objectives include,

- Creation of awareness on access to financial services and availability of different banking products and services.
- Motivate people to get accustomed to formal banking practices and in improving their financial conditions.
- Help consumers understand the rights and responsibilities regarding the use of financial services and products.
- Help financially excluded individuals to comprehend and access financial products and services at affordable costs;
- Enhance awareness of the availability of digital financial services and its benefits.
- Impart use and advantages of management of personal finance through budgeting.
- Change attitude towards financial services for translating knowledge into behavior.

Consumers/customers of the financial sector are eventual beneficiaries of interventions on financial education. Other things being the same, the national development is a function of access to financial services in promoting entrepreneurship, maintaining optimum effort to ensure inclusion of all segment of people through financial mainstreaming and consumer protection. Financial literacy is one of the sources of financial inclusion, access to finance and financial consumer protection. However, financial inclusion is a situation of equal, fair and sufficient environment of involvement into formal financial activities where and when they need. The women, low income and marginalized people, conflict victims and poor people are excluded from the financial mainstream primarily due to poor financial literacy. The level of financial literacy of Nepali is yet to study. Financial literacy is a demand side factor affecting access and inclusion in finance.

Financial literacy is an ongoing phenomenon. People have a general knowhow on financial and money matters such that the level of knowledge differs on the basis of society, literacy level, and urban and rural sector. On the basis of financial knowledge and its uses, the level of financial literacy can been divided into two categories:

(i) Basic

- The minimum degree of literacy required for all individuals from any type of background to navigate daily life.
- Financial concept
  - Needs and wants
  - Financial goals
  - Grievance handling
- Planning and managing
  - Household budget
  - Savings
  - Loans
  - Financial service providers
  - Remittance
  - Micro-enterprises and business plan
  - Risk management

(ii) Advanced

- The knowledge beyond the basic and fundamental financial concepts.
- Financial concept
  - Financial discipline
  - Digital financial services
  - Capital market
- Planning and managing
  - Diversified savings and loans
  - Rational financial decisions (long and short term)
  - Variants of digital financial services

FL contents are categorized according to the OECD into two broad Core competencies framework such as financial concepts and planning and managing, as indicated by change in (i) financial knowledge, skills and attitudes, (ii) behavioral changes, and (iii) financial outcomes. Financial concepts are more theory based that disseminate informative contents. Planning and managing include more application-based contents that have a direct impact on skills, attitude, behavior and outcomes.

Literacy programs need to arrange for participatory platforms and channels, and atune them according to educational needs of target consumer segment. Traditional (Face to face training, lecture, public campaigns, tv shows, radio programs, comic strips and audio visuals) and non-traditions (Internet, mobile messaging) delivery channels are sough after in the process. As with any literacy program, financial campaign is expected to have best outcomes when structured sequentially via interventions and programs that incorporate changes in the existing knowledge, skills and attitudes of the recipients.

Effective delivery of financial literacy involves multi-stakeholders, most of which are licensed/authorized to operate their business under the NRB's domain. Although undoubted that operation of banks in remote regions has increased financial access and promoted literacy at grass-root levels, there is still a bigger role to play by financial institutions in improving financial literacy among customers.
